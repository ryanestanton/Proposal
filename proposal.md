# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hand and Basic ASL Camera Recognition 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that recognizes hand features and some ASL through your camera and translates it.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project will take in an image from your camera of your hand and translate your hand gesture. Based off of prewritten software that reads the different parts of your hand and fingers and has it seperated into different sections, our project should be able to read and translate certain basic hand gestures and ASL signs into words from a camera. It will do this by reading someones hand from a camera and if it recognizes the gesture it will output what it means.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope we can at least get some sort of program working that recognizes some basic hand features or some simple ASL translations.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would include a program that can recognize more hand gestures and translate more complicated hand signals.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The more the program can recognize the better, I guess the best outcome would just be that we can get it to recognize as much ASL  or hand gestures as possible. Also, in the best outcome our software would be able to do this faster, with less problems, and would be as accurate as possible.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Once we finish downloading all of the necessary programs onto our computers and the hand recognition code needed, we will be able to start. Then our group can meet together in the next couple days so we can start and figure out the next steps and who will do certain parts of the project. We will start by initializing whatever is necessary and reading th actual frames from the camera in order to have the software recognize hand features, keypoints, and gestures. As we go through everything we will discuss who will be doing what and what extra research we may need in order to complete certain aspects.
